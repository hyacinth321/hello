Software Requirements Specification
============



1.Introduction
==============

1.1 Purpose
-----------
   This document describes the software requirements of oh my genes. It is intended for the users to identify differently expressed genes by given a gene expression file containing two cell samples.

1.2 Document conventions 
------------------------
 * Control sample - a cell sample prepared in its normal condition.
 * Treatment sample - a cell sample treated by special chemicals, or in which some genes are altered.
 * Differentially expressed genes - the genes which have significantly different expression levels between two samples.
 * Up-regulation - a gene is said to be up-regulated if it has higher expression in treatment than in control
 * logFC - log fold change of gene expression.  log_2 [T/C], where T is the gene expression level from a treatment sample, while C is the gene expression level from a control sample.

1.3 Intended audience
---------------------
 * Biologists in the Little Hill Laboratory for Optimal Life (potentially worldwide).

1.4 Contact information/SRS team members 
----------------------------------------
 * Lumos ----- Cai MengYuan & Jin RuoNi.
